## Plugins

I use plugins to speed up my workflow. Below are the ones I love and use on a daily basis. I wrote [an article](https://www.latimer.wiki/illustrator/layers) on how anyone can start using plugins efficiently.



### Astute Graphics

#### [Vector Scribe v3](https://astutegraphics.com/software/vectorscribe/) - Vector Editing, Shapes, Corners + Measure

- This plugin allows you to easily remove points, extend paths, and much more. I use this everyday.

#### [ColliderScribe v2](https://astutegraphics.com/software/colliderscribe/) - Align + Scatter + Snap to Objects

- My favorite feature is the Snap to Collision tool, which lets you snap objects together. I often use it as a replacement for the Selection tool.

#### [Phantasm v4](https://astutegraphics.com/software/phantasm/) - Vector Halftones, Colour Effects + Filters

- Phantasm allows me to make quick photo edits without leaving Illustrator. I primarily use it to desaturate images.

#### [MirrorMe](https://astutegraphics.com/software/mirrorme/) - Live Symmetry

- Ah.. another tool that SHOULD be native to Illustrator. I use this for logos, badges, and more.

#### [InkScribe](https://astutegraphics.com/software/inkscribe/) - Precise Path Making

- InkScribe is a better and more intuitive pen tool. I use this everyday.

#### [DirectPrefs (Free)](https://astutegraphics.com/software/inkscribe/) - Increments, Angles, Guides

- DirectPrefs offers a quick way to change Keyboard Increments. I often use it to increments to 0.001px for precise work. Oh and it's like, totally free.

## Templates

I create and use templates to save time and keep things consistant. Below are the ones I love and use on a daily basis. I wrote [an article](https://www.latimer.wiki/illustrator/layers) on how anyone can start using templates efficiently.

### All-purpose

#### [Basic](https://github.com/baileylatimer/illustrator-files/blob/master/Basic_V01.ait) - Beginner template

- The basic template contains a barebones structure for you to extend and customize. It saved me a lot of time in my life.

- It has four layers, basic swatches, and empty graphic styles/symbols.




#### [Advanced](https://github.com/baileylatimer/illustrator-files/blob/master/Advanced_V01.ait) - In-depth template

- The advanced template extends barebones structure to include new layers. It's useful for experienced designers looking to supercharge their workflow.

- It has seven layers, Material Design swatches, and empty graphic styles/symbols.
